# Frontend Test

### A few notes on what I learned and what I would do differently

1. I would recommend going through the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) documentation to get a better understanding of how components work and how to use them. I had to spend a lot of time looking at the source code to figure out how to use the components.

2. Since Intended output of the project is to create a storybook for the components used in the project. Understanding how storybook works is essential. I would recommend going through the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) documentation to get a better understanding of how storybook works.

## NB : I have not used storybook in this project. I have used the components directly in the project.

3. I would recommend using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to manage state in the project.

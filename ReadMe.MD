# Frontend Test

### A few notes on what I learned and what I would do differently

1. I would recommend going through the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) documentation to get a better understanding of the components used in the project.

2. Since Intended output of the project is to create a storybook for the components used in the project. Understanding how storybook works is essential.

3. I would recommend using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to manage state in the project.

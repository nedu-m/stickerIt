# Frontend Test

### A few notes on what I learned and what I would do differently

1. I would recommend going through the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) documentation to get a better understanding of how components work and how to use them. I had to spend a lot of time looking at the source code to figure out how to use the components.

2. Since Intended output of the project is to create a storybook for the components used in the project. Understanding how storybook works is essential. I would recommend going through the [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) documentation to get a better understanding of how storybook works.

## NB : I have not used storybook in this project. I have used the components directly in the project.

3. Serialize and Deserialize JSON data to bend it to your will. I would recommend going through the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) documentation to get a better understanding of how JSON works.
